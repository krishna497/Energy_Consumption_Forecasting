# Energy_Consumption_Forecasting

Forecasting energy consumption can be useful for optimizing the energy generation process. Furthermore, it can play a major role in comprehensive planning, operation, management, and cascade utilization of energy systems. It can also act as a key technology to promote the energy market. In this project, we will use the historical data of monthly electricity consumption and forecast the demand for the next 3 years.
